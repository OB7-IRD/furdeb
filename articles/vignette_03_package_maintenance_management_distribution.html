<h2 id="documentation">Documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documentation"></a>
</h2>
<p>Today, it’s impossible to find a modern package without documentation
associated. Document your code and globally your software is an
essential part of his development. Do without is a very dangerous way
which may cause problems in the future, especially if you work with
several colleagues or even if you package became complex. Historically
painful, this process is well assisted, especially with the association
to other packages. Furthermore, you will see that there are several
“level” of documentation and each have specific and transversal
aims.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="documenting-functions">Documenting functions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#documenting-functions"></a>
</h3>
<p>Documenting functions is the first step of the global documentation
process. This kind of documentation will produce user information, like
the arguments of your function, who to specify them and some other
specification like what your function return. The way to doing that has
been made much easier by modern package, especilly one collaed <a href="https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">roxygen2</a>. R help files use a
complicated syntax similar to LaTeX that can be easy to mess up. Instead
of writing this all ourselves using Roxygen lets us just write some
special comments at the start of each function. This has the extra
advantage of keeping the documentation with the code which make it
easier to keep it up to date.</p>
<p>Roxygen process work through tags that you will add at the begging of
your code. Tag’s syntax begin with <code>#'</code> associated to
<code>@something</code> for call a specific tag. For start, you can
generate a Roxygen skeleton from your function in RStudio, by opne the
<em>Code</em> menu and select <em>Roxygen skeleton</em>.</p>
<p>There are a <a href="https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#tags" class="external-link">lot of
tags</a> that you can use but you will find below the “most” common and
useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>@name</code> - Define the topic name (same name as your
function below the documentation).</li>
<li>
<code>@title</code> - Define the title of your documentation.</li>
<li>
<code>@description</code> - Describre</li>
<li>
<code>@param</code> - Describe a function input. Should describe
acceptable input types and how it affects the output. The syntax is
<code>name</code> follwing by a space and <code>description</code>. The
description is usually one or two sentences but can be as long as
needed. Document multiple arguments by separating their names with
commas without spaces.</li>
<li>
<code>@return</code> - Describe the function’s output. Typically
will be a 1-2 sentence description of the output type, but might also
include discussion of important errors or warnings.</li>
<li>
<code>@details</code> - Additional details about the function.</li>
<li>
<code>@examples</code> - Executable R code that demonstrates how the
function works. Code must run without error.</li>
<li>
<code>@examplesIf</code> - The syntax is <code>TRUE</code> or
<code>FALSE</code> following on the next line by an example code. Run
examples only when condition is <code>TRUE</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>@importFrom</code> - Write in the NAMESPACE file which
function(s) you use in our code from which package(s).</li>
<li>
<code>@export</code> - Adding in the NAMESPACE that this is a
function that we want to be available to the user. If we had an internal
function that wasn’t meant to be used by the user we would leave out
<code>@export</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>@keywords</code> - Initially use for increase the efficient of
the searching process dealing with you package, if you add
<code>@keywords internal</code> you will remove the function from the
documentation index. It’s useful if you want to create a global
documentation help when you write ?package_name in the R console.</li>
</ul>
<p>For bulding your documentation you can click on the section
<code>Build</code> on the RStudio interface, <code>More</code> with the
gear logo and <code>Document</code>. You can also launch the following
code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">devtools</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">document</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s also advising configuring an update of the documentation when
you compile your package. You have to configure that once through the
<code>Configuration Build Tools</code> menu (section <code>Build</code>
and subsection <code>More</code>) in the tab <code>Configure</code> near
the ticked line <code>Generate documentation with Roxygen</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="global-package-documentation">Global package documentation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#global-package-documentation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Users can find out about our functions using
<code>?function-name</code> but what if they want to find out about the
package itself? There is some information in the
<code>DESCRIPTION</code> but that can be hard to access. Let’s add a
help file for the package. Launch the following line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_package_doc</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="vignettes">Vignettes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#vignettes"></a>
</h3>
<p>This is the second level of documentation. In the previous section,
we documenting functions and our package. Vignettes are short tutorials
that explain what the package is designed for and how different
functions can be used together. Usually, they are write in <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" class="external-link">R Markdown</a> files. In RStudio,
you can click on the <code>Help</code> menu and
<code>Markdown Quick Reference</code> for display a quick guide to how
the R Markdown format work. To create your first vignette, use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_vignette</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"vignette_name"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To see what the vignette looks like run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">devtools</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">build_vignettes</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Asking <a href="https://devtools.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">devtools</a> to build
the vignette rather than rendering it in another way (such as the Knit
button in RStudio) makes sure that we are using the development version
of the package rather than any version that is installed. The rendered
vignette(s) will be create in the new directory called
<code>doc/</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="readme-file">README file<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#readme-file"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you plan on sharing the source code rather than the built package
it is useful to have a README file to explain what the package is, how
to install and use it, how to contribute etc. For example, if you
planned to use GitHub, the README will be associated to the “welcome
page” of the repository associated. Using R, the best way is to create a
.Rmd for a rich intermingling of code and output (use .md for a basic
README).</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_readme_rmd</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Rmd will be automatically added to .Rbuildignore. Furtermore, if the
current project is a Git repo, then <code>use_readme_rmd()</code>
automatically configures a pre-commit hook that helps keep README.Rmd
and README.md, synchronized. The hook creates friction if you try to
commit when README.Rmd has been edited more recently than README.md. If
this hook causes more problems than it solves for you, it is implemented
in .git/hooks/pre-commit, which you can modify or even delete.</p>
<p>There are the comments near the top that mention badges and you might
have seen badges (or shields) on README files in code repositories
before. Theses badges include visual information in the README file,
such as the CRAN version, test coverage and link out to relevant
external resources. Take a look on the <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/badges.html" class="external-link">badge
documentation</a> to know more about that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="package-website">Package website<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#package-website"></a>
</h3>
<p>This is one of the most interesting section regarding the
documentation. If you have a publicly available package it can be useful
to have a website displaying the package documentation. It’s just like a
friendly display of all the documentation that you have design through
sections before. Furthermore, it gives your users somewhere to go and
helps your package appear in search results. for that task you can use
the package <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">pkgdown</a>. If you
have it installed, you can set it iu with the following line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_pkgdown</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github_pages.html" class="external-link">usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()</a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="checking-and-testing">Checking and testing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#checking-and-testing"></a>
</h2>
<p>Verify your package is one of the thing that you have to do many and
many time, especially if you modify the code or add new functions. Run
the process frequently should simplify your development and corrections
should improve your code writing in the future. Typically, there are two
kinds of verification, the checking and the testing.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="checking">Checking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#checking"></a>
</h3>
<p>Aim of this point is to check that your package don’t have any
mistake in term of structure and syntax. This is essential if you want
to submit your package to CRAN because you must not have any errors or
warnings. For doing that the most easier way is to launch the following
code in the package directory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">devtools</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">check</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You should saw several outputs with at the end a subdivision of three
parts: errors, warnings and notes. The goals is to have 0 error or
warning and less a possible notes. Errors happen when you code has
broken and failed one of the checks. If errors are not fixed your
package will not work correctly. Warnings are slightly less serious but
should also be addressed. Your package will probably work without fixing
thise but it is highly advised that you do. Notes are advice rather than
problems. It can be up to you whether or not to address them but there
is usally a good reason to. Keep in your mind that the checking process
will stop if we encount an error. Information about the error will be
display in the output, but the correction of it does not guarantee that
you shouldn’t have another error occur (this is a sequential process).
Everything work fine when you have at the end only notes or in the best
case nothing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="testing">Testing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#testing"></a>
</h3>
<p>Testing your package is the section kind of verification that you can
do. The function <code>devtools::check()</code> verify that our package
passes standard checks, like for the typing or code/package structure,
but we don’t verify that our functions work in the way that we expect.
This is where unit tests highlight. One approach to writing unit tests
is what is known as “test-driven development”. The idea here is to write
the tests before you write a function. This way you know exactly what a
function is supposed to do and what problems there might be. While this
is a good principle, it can take a lot of advance planning. A more
common approach could be called “bug-driven testing”. For this approach
whenever we come across a bug, we write a test for it before we fix it,
that way the same bug should never happen an again. When combined with
some tests for obvious problems, this is a good compromise better
testing for every possible outcome and not testing at all.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to write unit tests for R packages but one of
the easier way is to use the <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">testthat</a> package. We can set
everything up with the following command line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_testthat</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, when you run checking process through
<code>devtools::check()</code>, all tests associated to our package will
run too. For create a new test file you can use the following command
line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_test</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"name_test_file"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each set of tests starts with the <code>test_that()</code> function.
This function has two arguments, a description and the code with the
tests that we want to run. Inside the code section we see an expect
function. This function also has two parts, the thing we want to test
and what we expect it to be. There are different <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/index.html" class="external-link">functions</a> for
different types of expectations.</p>
<p>To run our tests we use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu">devtools</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">test</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to see what parts of your code need testing you can run
the <code>devtools::test_coverage()</code> function (you might need to
install the <code>DT</code> package first). This function uses the
<code>covr</code> package to make a report showing which lines of your
code are covered by tests.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dependencies"></a>
</h2>
<p>Using functions from other packages can save you time and effort in
development but it might make it more difficult to maintain your
package. Deciding which packages (and how many) to depend on is a
difficult and philosophical choice. Some things you might want to
consider before depending on a package are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much of the functionality of the package do you want to
use?</li>
<li>Could you easily reproduce that functionality?</li>
<li>How well maintained is the package?</li>
<li>How often is it updated? Packages that change a lot are more likely
to break your code.</li>
<li>How many dependencies of it’s own does that package have?</li>
<li>Are you users likely to have the package installed already?</li>
</ul>
<p>When it’s clear in your mind that the best solution is to use
function(s) from other packages, you have to specify in your package
what kind of dependency you have. There are three main types of
dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>imports</code> - this means that we use functions from these
packages and they must be installed when our pacakge is installed.</li>
<li>
<code>suggests</code> - these are packages that we use in developing
our package (such as <a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">testthat</a>)
or packages that provide some additional, optional functionality. These
packages aren’t usually installed and you need to do a check before
using them.</li>
<li>
<code>depends</code> - shouldn’t usually be used unless your package
closely complements another package. For example, depends is necessary
is if you package mainly operates on an object defined by another
package.</li>
</ul>
<p>To declare a dependency, the best way is to use the function <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_package.html" class="external-link">use_package</a>.
In practice, we advise advice to an optionally argument of the function,
min_version, which specify what is the minimum version of the package
that you have to install, according to the version that you have on your
computer. With that, you reduce the risk of incompatibility when you
share your package to other people.</p>

<p>When you add a dependency through this process you should have a
message like that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Refer to functions with <span class="st">`</span><span class="at">package_name::fun()</span><span class="st">`</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our code you have two solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>when you call a function from another package, call with the syntax
<code>package_name::function_name()</code>
</li>
<li>write the call of the function without package_name:: and add in
NAMESPACE file the line
<code>importFrom(package_name,function_name)</code>. You can add this
line by hand in theory, but it’s highly recommended to use the
documentation generation of roxygen2 with the syntax
<code>#' @importFrom package_name function_name</code> (take a look to
the section X.X dedicates to the documentation generation). If a
function has the same name in different packages, use the first
codification to avoid any mistake.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the function associated to the explanation above appear several
time in our package, you can only import it once. It doesn’t matter
where we put the <code>@importFrom</code> line (or how many times) it
will still be added to <code>NAMESPACE</code>. This means we can put all
import in a central location. The advantage of this is that they only
appear once and are all in one place but it makes it harder to know
which of our functions have which imports and remove them if they are no
longer needed. Which approach you take is up to you.</p>

<p>Managing the evolution of your package is one of the challenge that
you will have to deal when you develop your package. Very few users
complain when a package gains features or gets a bug fix. Instead, it’s
become more complicated when we begging to make some breaking changes,
such as removing a function or narrowing the acceptable inputs for a
function. Since change is inevitable and in most time benefit for your
package, the best thing to do is to establish a clear communicate
channel between all the users and help them to adapted to change.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="package-version-number">Package version number<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#package-version-number"></a>
</h4>
<p>During the life of your package, it will change many times. If you
use a code sharing website like GitHub, the smallest increment of change
that’s meaningful is probably a Git commit. However, even if this state
is very useful for the maintainer and globally keep an history of your
package evolution, the primary signal of meaningful change is to
increment the package version number and release it.</p>
<p>Using the good practices, is useless if you don’t have a good
versioning system of your package. It’s more important and relevant when
it comes to things like solving user issues or deploy/share your work
with others peoples. Formally, an R package version is a sequence of at
least two integers separated by either <code>.</code> or <code>-</code>.
For example, <code>1.0</code> and <code>0.9.1-10</code> are valid
versions, but <code>1</code> and <code>1.0-devel</code> are not.
Furthermore, R considers that version like <code>1.9</code> to be equal
to <code>1.9.0</code>, and by addition less than <code>1.9.2</code>. In
the modern package of the tidyverse universe, several conventions are
recommended in addition to managing your package version number:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always use . as the separator, never -.</li>
<li>A released version number consists of three numbers,
<code>major.minor.patch</code>. Never use versions like
<code>1.0</code>. Always spell out the three components,
<code>1.0.0</code>. For example version number <code>1.9.2</code>:
<ul>
<li>1 is the <code>major</code> number. This is a significant change to
the package that would be expected to break users code,</li>
<li>9 is the <code>minor</code> number. A minor version update means
that new functionality has been added to the package. It might be new
functions to improvements to existing functions that are compatible with
most existing code.</li>
<li>2 is the <code>patch</code> number. Patch updates are bug fixes.
They solve existing issues but don’t do anything new.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An in-development package has a fourth component, the development
version. This should start at 9000. The number 9000 is arbitrary, but
provides a clear signal that there’s something different about this
version number. There are two reasons for this practice. First, the
presence of a fourth component makes it easy to tell if you’re dealing
with a released or in-development version. Also, the use of the fourth
place means that you’re not limited to what the next released version
will be. <code>0.0.1</code>, <code>0.1.0</code>, and <code>1.0.0</code>
are all greater than <code>0.0.0.9000</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of semantic is inspired in part by <a href="https://semver.org/" class="external-link">Semantic Versioning</a> and by the <a href="https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xorg-docs/Versions.html" class="external-link">X.Org</a>
versioning schemes.</p>
<p>Now we know the design of the version format, the next step is to
decide which type of release you make. The transition from 0.3.1 to
0.3.2, which is a patch release, has a very different vibe from the
transition from 0.3.2 to 1.0.0, which is a major release. A key concept
to solve that is whether the associated changes are backward compatible,
meaning that pre-existing code will still “work” with the new version. A
change that is not backward compatible is often described as a breaking
change. In practice, backward compatibility is not a clear-cut
distinction. A good way to distinguish a breaking change is to answer
the following question: does all the script create with functions of my
package will running without any modifications if I update my package?
Is the answer is no, your update is a breaking change and you need to
update the major number of your version package.</p>
<p>Here are some concrete examples of breaking change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing a function,</li>
<li>Removing an argument,</li>
<li>Narrowing the set of valid inputs to a function.</li>
</ul>
<p>In opposition, these examples are usually not considered
breaking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a function,</li>
<li>Adding an argument,</li>
<li>Increasing the set of valid inputs,</li>
<li>Changing the text of a print method or error,</li>
<li>Fixing a bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>All examples above are global case and of course some of your
specification could change the breaking consideration associated.</p>
<p>In addition, the figure below could help you when you will update
your package version.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;" src="images/package_version_updating.png"></p>
<p>In practice, the function <code>use_version()</code> (from the
package <code>usethis</code>, documentation associated <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_version.html" class="external-link">here</a>)
can provide a clever support for updating your package version. If your
package is associated with a Git repository, you can also prepare a
commit for version updated.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># for interactive selection</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_version</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="co"># for specify a level of increment. </span></span>
<span><span class="co"># you can choose in the argument which between "major", "minor", "patch" or "dev".</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># the process will propose to you to create a commit associated with the updated version.</span></span>
<span><span class="co"># with the argument push = TRUE (by default FALSE) you can directly make a commit and push it on the repository associated.</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_version</span><span class="op">(</span>which <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"dev"</span>,</span>
<span>                     push <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In addition to the update of your package version number, it’s
important to record what changes have been made. For that, good
practices suggest to create a new markdown file, called NEWS.md, at the
edge of your package directory. Another function, <a href="https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_news_md.html" class="external-link"><code>use_news_md</code></a>
can help you can create the initial file template.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># creation of the NEWS.md file</span></span>
<span><span class="fu">usethis</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu">use_news_md</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You are free to structure your NEWS.md file like you want but we
recommend at least to have this kind of structure (use only section
useful for your release/dev version):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># package_name major.minor.patch.dev - year-month-day</span></span>

<h4 id="lifecycle-stages-and-supporting-tools">Lifecycle stages and supporting tools<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lifecycle-stages-and-supporting-tools"></a>
</h4>
<p>In the tidyverse universe, package evolution become more structured
and deliberate over the years. The package <a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/" class="external-link">lifecycle</a> provide a succession
of tools for support your work. There are tow major components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifecycle stages, which can be applied at different levels. For
example to an individual argument or function or to an entire
package.</li>
<li>Conventions and functions to use when transitioning a function from
one lifecycle stage to another. The deprecation process is the one that
demands the most care.</li>
</ul>
<p>The figure below present to you the four primary stages of the
tidyverse lifecycle.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 55%;" src="images/lifecycle_stage.png"></p>
<p>The four lifecycle stages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stable: this is the default stage and signals that users should feel
comfortable relying on a function or package.</li>
<li>Experimental: this is appropriate when a function is first
introduced and the maintainer reserves the right to change it without
much of a deprecation process. This is the implied stage for any package
with a major version of 0, i.e. that hasn’t had a 1.0.0 release
yet.</li>
<li>Deprecated: this applies to functionality that is slated for
removal. Initially, it still works, but triggers a deprecation warning
with information about preferred alternatives. After a suitable amount
of time and with an appropriate version change, such functions are
typically removed.</li>
<li>Superseded: this is a softer version of deprecated, where legacy
functionality is preserved as if in a time capsule. Superseded functions
receive only minimal maintenance, such as critical bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section level5">
<h5 id="badges">Badges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#badges"></a>
</h5>
<p>The lifecycle stage is often communicated through a badge. If you’d
like to use lifecycle badges, call <code>usethis::use_lifecycle()</code>
to do some one-time setup.</p>
<p>Now, you have three options to use lifecycle badges:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a function, include the badge in its <code>@description</code>
block like that</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#' @description</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#' `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#' `function_name()` has been deprecated in favour of the new function `new_function_name()`</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>for a function argument, include the badge in the
<code>@param</code> tag</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co">#' @param parameter_name `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`. Use the `argument_name` argument instead.</span></span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>for you entire package (add in the <code>README</code> file)</li>
</ul>

<p>During all the life of a package, you will be confronted several
times to a special moment: you development a new function or a new piece
of code and you have to integrate them in the source code. The key
question here is to ask yourself if you code will does not produce
regression in the developed application. The aims of the Continuous
Integration (CI) and Continuous Development (CD) is to detected problems
soon as possible in the development phase, automate execution of tests
and verification and, in a global view, monitor and manage the progress
of our software development.</p>
