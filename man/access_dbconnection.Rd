\arguments{
\item{driver_name}{{\link[base]{character}} expected. Access' driver name. By default "u_can_access" (free driver). You can also choose the driver "access_jdbc42" (paid driver).}

\item{access_db_path}{{\link[base]{character}} expected. Path of the Access database.}

\description{
Generate a common connection with an Access database using a JDBC driver.
}
\details{
Difference between drivers "u_can_access" and "access_jdbc42":
\itemize{
 \item{"u_can_access": }{the main advantage is it's a free java JDBC driver. To understand briefly the process behind, the Access database is converted in HSQLDB system. This conversion could take a long time, especially if the database if large. Furthermore, after the conversion, queries should be faster than if there run on an Access database.}
 \item{"access_jdbc42": }{this driver is paying. In opposition with the "u_can_access" driver, the Access database is not converted. The connection should be faster but the queries could be longer.}
}
