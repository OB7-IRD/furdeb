\arguments{
\item{...}{Names of the objects to be saved (as symbols or character strings).}

\item{list}{{\link[base]{character}} expected. A vector containing the names of objects to be saved.}

\item{output_file_path}{{\link[base]{character}} expected. Path name of the file where data will be saved.}

\item{cores_utilisation}{{\link[base]{character}} or {\link[base]{numeric}} expected. Percentage of cores to use to compress (value inferior or equal to 1 expected). Use "auto" for automatic management (number of cores minus 1).}

\item{precheck}{{\link[base]{logical}} expected. Should the existence of the objects be checked before starting to.}

\item{envir}{{\link[base]{envir}} expected. Environment to search for objects to be saved.}

\item{eval_promises}{{\link[base]{envir}} expected. Should objects which are promises be forced before saving?}

\description{
Save writes an external representation of R objects to the specified file using pigz parallel implementation compression (http://www.zlib.net/pigz/).
}
\details{
Under windows OS utilisation, download through this link (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pigz-for-windows/) the pigz executable file and place it in the System32 directory (C:\Windows\System32). The executable file is also available in the package directory (use the function system.file("pigz.exe", package = "furdeb") for located it).
